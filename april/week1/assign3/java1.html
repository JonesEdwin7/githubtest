        <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
            implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
            programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
            that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode
            that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The
            syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java
            runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically
            not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming
            languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for clientâ€“server web applications, with a
            reported 9 million developers.[21]



            Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java, due to
            unresolved security issues in older versions.[22] Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to a
            supported version, such as one of the LTS versions (8, 11, 17)..

        </p>
        <p> As of March 2022, Java 18 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support
            (LTS) versions. Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in
            January 2019 for commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for
            personal use indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are
            still receiving security and other upgrades.
